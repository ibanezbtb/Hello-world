# Hello-world
This is my first repository. I use it to learn how to handle and use Github. Comments are welcome. 
My name is John and I want to become a Full Stack Cloud Developer. 
I've started on the 11th of october 2020.
The course will take 12 months, but I already have some idea's about what I want to develop during this course. 
I have no IT background whatsoever but I have always found it an interesting field of knowledge.
